# Key Findings (Showcase)

This section summarizes the core insights and recommendations communicated in the slide deck.

## Insights
- **Moderate activity** shows the best sleep balance (≈ **7.75 hours**).
- **High activity** burns the most calories but corresponds to **less sleep**.
- Users spend roughly **~16 hours/day sedentary**; more movement does **not automatically** yield better sleep.
- **Engagement vs. Activity**: engagement levels do **not necessarily** correlate with activity; many users use the app **passively**.
- **Engagement vs. Sleep**: no strong link observed; suggests **different user priorities**.
- **Peak hours** of activity: **12–2 PM** and **5–7 PM**; **midweek dip** (Tue–Thu). **Sleep improves on weekends**.
- **Weight tracking is underused**: only **~13 users** logged weight data; manual input likely discourages usage.

## Recommendations
- **Personalized notifications**: adapt to user profile and time windows (workout prompts or wind‑down reminders).
- **Enhance engagement & retention**: challenges, streaks, leaderboards; segment by behavior.
- **Improve feature utilization**: increase visibility of weight tracking and integrate with related metrics to make logging meaningful.
